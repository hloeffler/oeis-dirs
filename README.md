map oeis data to many dirs
==========================

i toy around with http://oeis.org and try to map the data to a dir structure
its get big very fast, so next try will be a [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace)


run `get.sh` to get the data
        
run `./build.pl` to populate the dir **oeis**
